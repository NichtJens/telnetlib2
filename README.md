# telnetlib2

In [PEP 594](https://peps.python.org/pep-0594/#telnetlib), telnetlib has been deprecated. The library has been removed from Python 3.13 onwards.

telnetlib2 is telnetlib (the module, the test suite and the documentation) extracted from the [cpython git repo](https://github.com/python/cpython/) keeping the git history intact.
